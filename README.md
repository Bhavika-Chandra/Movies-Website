# Movies-Website
Overall, the js code sets up event listeners and functions to fetch and display movies from TMDB's API. It initially displays a list of all the recent movies then you can search for a particular movie. The retrieved movie information is dynamically added to the HTML document and gets displayed.

Note: One can not watch movies here, only a list of movies are displayed.
